[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ethereumjs/ethrpc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ethereumjs/ethrpc) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ethereumjs/ethrpc/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/ethereumjs/ethrpc?branch=master) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ethrpc.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ethrpc)

JavaScript RPC communication with the Ethereum network.

## Usage

ethrpc can be installed using npm:

```
npm install ethrpc
```

After installing, to use it with Node, require it and call connect:

```javascript
var rpc = require("ethrpc");
var connectionConfiguration = {
  httpAddresses: ["http://localhost:8545"], // optional, default empty array
  wsAddresses: [], // optional, default empty array
  ipcAddresses: [], // optional, default empty array
  networkID: 3, // optional, used to verify connection to the intended network (blockchain)
  connectionTimeout: 3000, // optional, default 3000
  errorHandler: function (err) { /* out-of-band error */ }, // optional, used for errors that can't be correlated back to a request
};
rpc.connect(connectionConfiguration, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Failed to connect to Ethereum node.");
  } else {
    console.log("Connected to Ethereum node!");
  }
});
```

A minified, browserified file `dist/ethrpc.min.js` is included for use in the browser.  Including this file simply attaches an `ethrpc` object to `window`:

```html
<script src="dist/ethrpc.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### Basic RPC

The `raw` method allows you to send in commands that won't be parsed/mangled by ethrpc.  (Similar to sending RPC requests with cURL.)

```javascript
rpc.raw("net_peerCount");
"0x10"
```

Almost all commands listed in the [Ethereum JSON RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) wiki page have named wrappers:


```javascript
rpc.net.peerCount();
"0x10"

rpc.eth.blockNumber();
"0x35041"
```

### Block and Log Notifications

If you want to subscribe to new blocks or new logs you can get access to a [block and log streamer](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-blockstream) via:

```javascript
var blockStream = rpc.getBlockStream();
```

With that, you can then subscribe to new blocks, subscribe to new logs, add log filters (by default you will receive no logs) and subscribe to be notified when blocks/logs are removed as well.

```javascript
var onBlock = function (block) { /* block party! */ };
var onLog = function (log) { /* log party... */ };
var onBlockAddedSubscriptionToken = blockStream.subscribeToOnBlockAdded(onBlock);
var onLogAddedSubscriptionToken = blockStream.subscribeToOnLogAdded(onLog);
var onBlockRemovedSubscriptionToken = blockStream.subscribeToOnBlockRemoved(onBlock);
var onLogRemovedSubscriptionToken = blockStream.subscribeToOnLogRemoved(onLog);
var logFilterToken = blockStream.addLogFilter({
  address: "0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef",
  topics: ["0xbadf00dbadf00dbadf00dbadf00dbadf00dbadf00dbadf00dbadf00dbaadf00d"]
});
blockStream.unsubscribeFromOnBlockAdded(onBlockAddedSubscriptionToken);
blockStream.unsubscribeFromOnBlockRemoved(onBlockRemovedSubscriptionToken);
blockStream.unsubscribeFromOnLogAdded(onLogAddedSubscriptionToken);
blockStream.unsubscribeFromOnLogRemoved(onLogRemovedSubscriptionToken);
blockStream.removeLogFilter(logFilterToken);
```

### Contract upload and download

`publish` broadcasts (uploads) a compiled contract to the network:

```javascript
var txHash = rpc.publish("0x603980600b6000396044567c01000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000350463643ceff9811415603757600a60405260206040f35b505b6000f3");
// txHash:
"0x6a532c807eb49d78bf0fb7962743c7f155a4b2fc1258b749df85c88b66fc3316"

// To get the contract's address, after the transaction is sealed (mined), get its receipt:
var address = rpc.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash).contractAddress;
// address:
"0x86fb6d1f1bd78cc13c6354b6436b6ea0c144de2e"
```

`getCode` downloads code from a contract already on the Ethereum network:

```javascript
var contractCode = rpc.eth.getCode("0x86fb6d1f1bd78cc13c6354b6436b6ea0c144de2e");
// contractCode:
"0x7c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060003504636ffa1caa81141560415760043560405260026040510260605260206060f35b50"
```

### Contract methods: call and sendTransaction

The `callOrSendTransaction` method executes a method in a contract already on the network.  It can broadcast transactions to the network and/or capture return values by calling the contract method(s) locally.

```javascript
// The method called here doubles its input argument.
var payload = {
  to: "0x5204f18c652d1c31c6a5968cb65e011915285a50",
  name: "double",
  signature: ["int256"],
  params: ["0x5669"], // parameter value(s)
  send: false,
  returns: "int"
};
rpc.callOrSendTransaction(payload);
// returns:
44242
```

The transaction payload is structured as follows:

Required:

- to: `<contract address> (hexstring)`
- name: `<function name> (string)`
- signature: `<function signature, e.g. ["int256", "bytes", "int256[]"]> (array)`
- params: `<parameters passed to the function>`

Optional:

- send: `<true to sendTransaction, false to call (default)>`
- from: `<sender's address> (hexstring; defaults to the coinbase account)`
- returns: `<"int256" (default), "int", "number", "int256[]", "number[]", or "string">`

The `params` and `signature` fields are required if your function accepts parameters; otherwise, these fields can be excluded.  The `returns` field is used only to format the output, and does not affect the actual RPC request.

## Tests

Unit tests are included in `test/ethrpc.js`, and can be run using npm:

```
npm test
```

Alternatively, you can run the tests inside of a docker container.  Docker layer caching is leveraged to make it so the build is very fast after the first time (unless you change dependencies):

```
docker build -t ethrpc . && docker run --rm ethrpc
```

## Internal Architecture

Upon calling `connect`, a `Transporter` will be instantiated with the supplied addresses to connect to.  A `Transport` will be created for each of the supplied addresses plus one for web3.  Once they have all either successfully connected or failed to connect, `Transporter` will choose the first address for each transport type (HTTP, WS, IPC, Web3) that connected successfully and use that as the `Transport` for that transport type.  The transport will be chosen automatically based on a preference of `Web3 > IPC > WS > HTTP`.  If no transports are available, the request will fail.  The `Transports` each have their own internal queue of work and if they lose a connection they will queue up incoming requests until a connection can be re-established.  Once it is, the queue will be pumped until empty.
